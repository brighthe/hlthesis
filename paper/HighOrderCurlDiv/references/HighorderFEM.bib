  abstract = {Bernstein polynomials, long a staple of approximation theory and computational geometry, have also increasingly become of interest in finite element methods. Many fundamental problems in interpolation and approximation give rise to interesting linear algebra questions. In [13], we gave block-structured algorithms for inverting the Bernstein mass matrix on simplicial cells but did not study fast algorithms for the univariate case. Here, we give several approaches to inverting the univariate mass matrix based on exact formulae for the inverse; decompositions of the inverse in terms of Hankel, Toeplitz, and diagonal matrices; and a spectral decomposition. In particular, the eigendecomposition can be explicitly constructed in \textbackslash scrO (n2) operations, while its accuracy for solving linear systems is comparable to that of the Cholesky decomposition. Moreover, we study conditioning and accuracy of these methods from the standpoint of the effect of roundoff error in the L2 norm on polynomials, showing that the conditioning in this case is far less extreme than in the standard 2-norm.},

  abstract = {Fast algorithms for applying finite element mass and stiffness operators to the B-form of polynomials over d-dimensional simplices are derived. These rely on special properties of the Bernstein basis and lead to stiffness matrix algorithms with the same asymptotic complexity as tensor-product techniques in rectangular domains. First, special structure leading to fast application of mass matrices is developed. Then, by factoring stiffness matrices into products of sparse derivative matrices with mass matrices, fast algorithms are also obtained for stiffness matrices.},

These algorithms are based on realizing the exterior calculus bases as short combinations of Bernstein polynomials. Numerical results confirm optimal scaling of the algorithms and favorable comparison with FEniCS at high polynomial order as well. Additional empirical studies show that very high accuracy is achieved in the mixed discretization of the Poisson equation and the Maxwell eigenvalue problem as the polynomial degree increases.},
