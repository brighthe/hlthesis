	abstract="In this chapter we present an overview of the basic ingredients of what we will denote as the material distribution method for finding the optimum lay-out of a linearly elastic structure. In this context the ``lay-out'' of the structure includes information on the topology, shape and sizing of the structure and the material distribution method allows for addressing all three problems simultaneously.",
