  abstract         = {In this work we present an adaptive boundary-integral equation method for computing the electromagnetic response of wave interactions in hyperbolic metamaterials. The indefiniteness of the permittivity tensor gives rise to preferential wave radiation within the propagating cone for the hyperbolic media, and this induces sharp transition for the solution of the integral equation across the cone boundary when waves start to decay or grow exponentially. In order to avoid a global refined mesh over the whole boundary, we employ a two-level a posteriori error estimator and an adaptive mesh refinement procedure to resolve the singularity locally for the solution of the integral equation. Such an adaptive procedure allows for the reduction of the number of the degrees of freedom significantly for the integral equation solver while achieving desired accuracy for the solution. In addition, to resolve the fast transition of the fundamental solution and its derivatives accurately across the propagation cone boundary, adaptive numerical quadrature rules are applied to evaluate the integrals for the stiffness matrices. Finally, to formulate the integral equations over the boundary we also derive the limits of layer potentials and their derivatives in the hyperbolic media when the target points approach the boundary.},

However, unlike Berenger's technique, the uniaxial PML absorbing medium presented in this paper is based on a Maxwellian formulation. Numerical examples demonstrate that the FDTD implementation of the uniaxial PML medium is stable, equal in effectiveness as compared to Berenger's PML medium, while being more computationally efficient.},

This study investigates the dependence of nonreciprocal phase shifts on the width and the thickness of the waveguides, and we investigate the dependence of losses on the air hole depth, leading to a guideline for the design of optical isolators. Simulations show that waveguides with reduced width and deep air holes exhibit high nonreciprocal phase shifts and low losses. The study also shows that, compared with two-dimensional calculations, nonreciprocal phase shifts express key similarities, although the frequencies of the guided modes shift.},

This representation holds at least for the time period inversely proportional to the appropriate norm of the solution to the linear Maxwell equation.

Poor light coupling performance of butt-coupler can be mitigated by implementing tapered coupler at the expense of long coupler section. In order to reduce coupling losses, a new coupling device approach based on graded index (GRIN) concept is proposed. The refractive index distribution is in the form of modified version of the Maxwell fish-eye lens. The inhomogeneous refractive index distribution is approximated by photonic crystals (PCs) such that the positions of each PC rods are appropriately arranged. Strong electric field focusing ability of the designed GRIN PC medium provides relatively high coupling efficiency that is around 90\%. Spectral region corresponding to coupling efficiency over 75\% has a bandwidth of $\Delta$$\omega$ $=$ 18.56\% (284 nm). Finally, we discuss the durability of the proposed coupler against the lateral displacement and angular misalignment of output waveguides.},

  abstract = {Metamaterials allow for extraordinary electromagnetic properties that are not attainable in nature1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Indefinite media with hyperbolic dispersion, in particular, have found intriguing applications10,11,12,13. The miniaturization of optical cavities increases the photon density of states and therefore enhances light–matter interactions for applications in modern optoelectronics. However, scaling down the optical cavity is limited to the diffraction limit and by the reduced quality factor. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an optical cavity made of indefinite metamaterials that confines the electromagnetic field to an extremely small space. The experiments reveal that indefinite cavities demonstrate anomalous scaling laws: cavities with different sizes can resonant at the same frequency, and a higher-order resonance mode oscillates at a lower frequency. We also demonstrate a universal fourth power law for the radiation quality factor of the wave vector. Cavities with sizes down to λ/12 are realized with ultrahigh optical indices (up to 17.4), a feature that is critically important for many applications14,15,16,17,18.},

  abstract  = {Miniaturization of optical cavities has numerous advantages for enhancing light{\textendash}matter interaction in quantum optical devices, low-threshold lasers with minimal power consumption, and efficient integration of optoelectronic devices at large scale. However, the realization of a truly nanometer-scale optical cavity is hindered by the diffraction limit of the nature materials. In addition, the scaling of the photon life time with the cavity size significantly reduces the quality factor of small cavities. Here we theoretically present an approach to achieve ultrasmall optical cavities using indefinite medium with hyperbolic dispersion, which allows propagation of electromagnetic waves with wave vectors much larger than those in vacuum enabling extremely small 3D cavity down to (λ/20)3. These cavities exhibit size-independent resonance frequencies and anomalous scaling of quality factors in contrast to the conventional cavities, resulting in nanocavities with both high Q/Vm ratio and broad bandwidth.},

To simulate wave propagation in these devices, we introduce a perfectly matched layer (PML) to reduce the unbounded physical domain problem to a bounded domain problem. Using PML leads to a multi-physics problem with different governing equations in different subdomains, which makes the simulation quite challenging. By following the idea of leap-frog FDTD scheme, we develop the leap-frog RBF meshless method to solve these complicated coupled modeling equations. Extensive numerical results by using multiquadric RBF and Gaussian RBF are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our meshless method.},

Our formulation is based on the polarization terms and allows simple and consistent implementation of such media together with the anisotropic perfectly matched layer (APML) absorbing boundary condition. The disadvantages of the ADE technique, i.e., requiring additional storage for auxiliary variables, has been overcome by adopting the high-order finite-difference schemes derived from the previously reported wavelet-based formulation. With those techniques, we demonstrate in two-dimensional setting an effective and accurate numerical analysis of the spatio-temporal soliton propagation as a consequence of the physically originated balanced phenomena between the self-focusing effect of nonlinearity and the pulse broadening effects of the temporal dispersion and of the spatial diffraction.},

Optical metamaterial-based hyperlens exhibit the ability for spatial pattern compression from the micro- to nanoscale, potentially addressing the ever-increasing demand of photolithograpy for inexpensive, all-optical nanoscale pattern recoding. Here, we demonstrate a photolithography system enabling a feature size of 80 nm using a 405 nm laser source. To realize such a system, we developed a fabrication method to obtain very thick hyperbolic metamaterial enabling a hyperlens with a very large demagnification rate of 3.75. Finally, we discuss several steps necessary to transform the proposed technique into a practical solution for the visible-light-based nanolithography. These include flattening of the inner surface of the hyperlens to increase the working area and integrating the proposed device into a conventional stepper system.},

  abstract = {In this paper, based on the transformation optics theory as well as the complementary media ideas, we design a novel type of information-open (IO) cloaking devices by using nonlinear coordinate transformations. Finite element methods are used to design layered IO cylindrical cloaking devices. The equidistant and hierarchical layered designs of the IO cloaking devices are considered, and their cloaking performances are verified. Finally, by comparing the finite element numerical results, we find that satisfactory IO cloaking performances can be obtained with fewer layers by the hierarchical layered design. As far as we know, this is the first work on the hierarchical design of IO cloaking devices via nonlinear transformations.},

  abstract = {Novel time domain finite element methods are proposed to numerically solve the
system of Maxwell’s equations with a cubic nonlinearity in the spatial 3D case. The effects of linear
and nonlinear electric polarization are precisely modeled in this approach. In order to achieve an
energy stable discretization at the semi-discrete and the fully discrete levels, a novel technique is
developed to handle the discrete nonlinearity, with spatial discretization either using edge and face
elements (Nédélec-Raviart-Thomas) or discontinuous spaces and edge elements (Lee-Madsen). In
particular, the proposed time discretization scheme is unconditionally stable with respect to the
electromagnetic energy and is free of any Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy-type condition. Optimal error
estimates are presented at semi-discrete and fully discrete levels for the nonlinear problem. The
methods are robust and allow for discretization of complicated geometries and nonlinearities of
spatially 3D problems that can be directly derived from the full system of nonlinear Maxwell’s
equations.},

Among these artificial nanostructured materials, 3D bulk hyperbolic metamaterials and 2D planar hyperbolic metasurfaces exhibit ultra-anisotropic electromagnetic responses and lead to dramatic changes for the light propagation behaviors. Here, the dispersions and realizations of hyperbolic media are first briefly discussed. Then, the recent achievements of various optical applications based on hyperbolic metamaterials and metasurfaces, including beam manipulation, super-resolution imaging, spontaneous and thermal emission engineering, ultrasensitive optical sensing, and broadband optical absorption are reviewed. This review provides an overview and vision for the future of hyperbolic media and their potential impact on the development of novel nanophotonic devices and systems.},

The microstructure is on a scale much less than the wavelength of radiation, is not resolved by incident microwaves, and uses a very low density of metal so that structures can be extremely lightweight. Most of the structures are resonant due to internal capacitance and inductance, and resonant enhancement combined with compression of electrical energy into a very small volume greatly enhances the energy density at critical locations in the structure, easily by factors of a million and possibly by much more. Weakly nonlinear materials placed at these critical locations will show greatly enhanced effects raising the possibility of manufacturing active structures whose properties can be switched at will between many states.},

Effective mode transformation is achieved with a spot-size conversion ratio of 12:1. The low transmission efficiency (30%) that occurs in a direct coupling from dielectric waveguide into the PCW is raised to ~80% (0.98 dB) over a broad frequency range. Further improvements for nearly perfect transmission appear to be feasible.},

  abstract  = {This chapter reviews key elements of the theoretical foundation and numerical implementation of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solutions of Maxwell's equations. FDTD and related space-grid time-domain techniques are direct solution methods for Maxwell's curl equations. These methods employ no potentials; rather they are based on volumetric sampling of the unknown electric and magnetic fields in and surrounding the structure of interest over a period of time. FDTD is one of the most powerful and widely used numerical modeling approaches for electromagnetic wave interaction problems. With expanding developer and user communities in an increasing number of disciplines in science and engineering, FDTD technology is continually evolving in terms of its theoretical basis, numerical implementation, and technological applications, which now span the spectral range from low-frequency (ELF) to daylight. FDTD and related techniques are marching-in-time procedures that simulate the continuous actual electromagnetic waves in a finite spatial region by sampled-data numerical analogs propagating in a computer data space. Time-stepping continues as the numerical wave analogs propagate in the space lattice to causally connect the physics of the modeled region. Predictive dynamic range is also focused in the chapter. For computational modeling of electromagnetic wave interaction structures using FDTD and related space-grid time-domain techniques, it is useful to consider the concept of a predictive dynamic range. {\textcopyright} 2005},

  abstract  = {Abstract In this paper, we review the early motivation for photonic crystal research which was derived from the need for a photonic bandgap in quantum optics. This led to a series of experimental and theoretical searches for the elusive photonic bandgap structures: those three-dimensionally periodic dielectric structures which are to photon waves, as semiconductor crystals are to electron waves. We shall describe how the photonic semiconductor can be ‘doped’, producing tiny electromagnetic cavities. Finally, we shall summarize some of the anticipated implications of photonic band structure for quantum electronics and the prospects for the creation of photonic crystals in the optical domain.},

  abstract  = {Non-standard finite element methods, in particular mixed methods, are central to many applications. In this text the authors, Boffi, Brezzi and Fortin present a general framework, starting with a finite dimensional presentation, then moving on to formulation in Hilbert spaces and finally considering approximations, including stabilized methods and eigenvalue problems. This book also provides an introduction to standard finite element approximations, followed by the construction of elements for the approximation of mixed formulations in H(div) and H(curl). The general theory is applied to some classical examples: Dirichlet's problem, Stokes' problem, plate problems, elasticity and electromagnetism.},
