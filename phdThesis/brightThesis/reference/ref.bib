	abstract = {The sixth editions of these seminal books deliver the most up to date and comprehensive reference yet on the finite element method for all engineers and mathematicians. Renowned for their scope, range and authority, the new editions have been significantly developed in terms of both contents and scope. Each book is now complete in its own right and provides self-contained reference; used together they provide a formidable resource covering the theory and the application of the universally used FEM. Written by the leading professors in their fields, the three books cover the basis of the method, its application to solid mechanics and to fluid dynamics.* This is THE classic finite element method set, by two the subject's leading authors * FEM is a constantly developing subject, and any professional or student of engineering involved in understanding the computational modelling of physical systems will inevitably use the techniques in these books * Fully up-to-date; ideal for teaching and reference},

It is a valuable reference and introduction to current research on the numerical analysis of the finite element method, and also a working textbook for graduate courses in numerical analysis. It includes many useful figures, as well as exercises of varying difficulty. Although nearly 25 years have passed since this book was first published, the majority of its content remains up-to-date. Chapters 1 through 6, which cover the basic error estimates for elliptic problems, are still the best available sources for material on this topic. The material covered in Chapters 7 and 8, however, has undergone considerable progress in terms of new applications of the finite element method. As such the author has provided a bibliography of recent texts that complement the classic material in these chapters.},

	abstract = {This study investigates high-order face and edge elements in finite element methods, with a focus on their geometric attributes, indexing management, and practical application. The exposition begins by a geometric decomposition of Lagrange finite elements, setting the foundation for further analysis. The discussion then extends to \$H(\textbackslash rm\textbraceleft div\textbraceright )\$-conforming and \$H(\textbackslash rm\textbraceleft curl\textbraceright )\$-conforming finite element spaces, adopting variable frames across differing sub-simplices. The imposition of tangential or normal continuity is achieved through the strategic selection of corresponding bases. The paper concludes with a focus on efficient indexing management strategies for degrees of freedom, offering practical guidance to researchers and engineers. It serves as a comprehensive resource that bridges the gap between theory and practice.},
