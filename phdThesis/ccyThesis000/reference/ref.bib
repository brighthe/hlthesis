                   discontinuous Galerkin composite finite element
                   method for the discretization of second-order
                   elliptic partial differential equations. This class
                   of methods allows for the approximation of problems
                   posed on computational domains which may contain a
                   huge number of local geometrical features, or
                   microstructures. While standard numerical methods can
                   be devised for such problems, the computational
                   effort may be extremely high, as the minimal number
                   of elements needed to represent the underlying domain
                   can be very large. In contrast, the minimal dimension
                   of the underlying composite finite element space is
                   independent of the number of geometric features. The
                   key idea in the construction of this latter class of
                   methods is that the computational domain \$\Omega\$
                   is no longer resolved by the mesh; instead, the
                   finite element basis (or shape) functions are adapted
                   to the geometric details present in \$\Omega\$. In
                   this paper, we extend these ideas to the
                   discontinuous Galerkin setting, based on employing
                   the \$hp\$-version of the finite element method.

                   application of the proposed numerical scheme will be

                   quadrilateral/polygonal meshes for elliptic problems.
                   The method can be flexibly applied to rough grids
                   such as the highly distorted trapezoidal grid, and
                   both \$h\$ perturbation and \$h^2\$ perturbation of
                   the smooth grids. Optimal convergence rates for both

                   smooth solutions. On the other hand, the lowest order
                   method can be particularly useful for computing rough
                   solutions. We provide a priori error analysis for

                   refinement is an attractive tool for general meshes

                   general meshes than the one typically considered in
                   the VEM literature. For instance, meshes with
                   arbitrarily small edges (with respect to the parent
                   element diameter) can be dealt with. Our general

                   ``classical'' one introduced in Ref. 4, and a recent
                   one presented in Ref. 34. Finally, we show that the

                   consider as the very basic features of the (brand
                   new) virtual element method. As the readers will
                   easily recognize, the virtual element method could
                   easily be regarded as the ultimate evolution of the
                   mimetic finite differences approach. However, in
                   their last step they became so close to the
                   traditional finite elements that we decided to use a
                   different perspective and a different name. Now the
                   virtual element spaces are just like the usual finite
                   element spaces with the addition of suitable
                   non-polynomial functions. This is far from being a
                   new idea. See for instance the very early approach of
                   E. Wachspress [A Rational Finite Element Basic
                   (Academic Press, 1975)] or the more recent overview
                   of T.-P. Fries and T. Belytschko [The
                   extended/generalized finite element method: An
                   overview of the method and its applications, Int. J.
                   Numer. Methods Engrg.84 (2010) 253--304]. The novelty
                   here is to take the spaces and the degrees of freedom
                   in such a way that the elementary stiffness matrix
                   can be computed without actually computing these
                   non-polynomial functions, but just using the degrees
                   of freedom. In doing that we can easily deal with
                   complicated element geometries and/or higher-order
                   continuity conditions (like C1, C2, etc.). The idea
                   is quite general, and could be applied to a number of
                   different situations and problems. Here however we
                   want to be as clear as possible, and to present the
                   simplest possible case that still gives the flavor of
                   the whole idea.},

                   well-posed, a condition of divergence is imposed on
                   the electric field. Then a Lagrange multiplier p is
                   introduced, and the problem becomes the solution of a
                   mixed curl--curl formulation of the Maxwell's
                   problem. We use polynomials of degree
                   {\$}{\$}k+1{\$}{\$}, k, k to approximate
  {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}{$\backslash$}varvec{\{}u{\}}{\}}{\}},{$\backslash$}nabla
  {$\backslash$}times {\{}{\{}{$\backslash$}varvec{\{}u{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}and
  p respectively. In contrast, we only use a non-trivial subspace of
  polynomials of degree {\$}{\$}k+1{\$}{\$}to approximate the numerical
  tangential trace of the electric field and polynomials of degree
  {\$}{\$}k+1{\$}{\$}to approximate the numerical trace of the Lagrange
  multiplier on the faces. On the simplicial meshes, we show that the
  convergence rates for {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}varvec{\{}u{\}}{\$}{\$}and
  {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}nabla {$\backslash$}times
  {$\backslash$}varvec{\{}u{\}}{\$}{\$}are independent of the Lagrange
  multiplier p. If we assume the dual operator of the Maxwell equation on the
  domain has adequate regularity, we show that the convergence rate for
  {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}varvec{\{}u{\}}{\$}{\$}is
  {\$}{\$}O(h\^{}{\{}k+2{\}}){\$}{\$}. From the point of view of degrees of
  freedom of the globally coupled unknown: numerical trace, this HDG method
  achieves superconvergence for the electric field without postprocessing.
  Finally, we show that the superconvergence of the HDG method is also derived
  on general polyhedral elements. Numerical results are given to verify the
  theoretical analysis.},

                   fit the structures of the approximation spaces. As
                   applications, we analyze four variants of HDG methods

  abstract =      {In this paper, we suggest a new heterogeneous
                   multiscale method (HMM) for the time-harmonic Maxwell
                   equations in locally periodic media. The method is
                   constructed by using a divergence-regularization in
                   one of the cell problems. This allows us to introduce
                   fine-scale correctors that are not subject to a
                   cumbersome divergence-free constraint and which can
                   hence easily be implemented. To analyze the method,
                   we first revisit classical homogenization theory for
                   time-harmonic Maxwell equations and derive a new
                   homogenization result that makes use of the
                   divergence-regularization in the two-scale
                   homogenized equation. We then show that the HMM is
                   equivalent to a discretization of this equation. In
                   particular, writing both problems in a fully coupled
                   two-scale formulation is the crucial starting point
                   for a corresponding numerical analysis of the method.
                   With this approach we are able to prove rigorous a
                   priori error estimates in the \$\mathbf{H}({curl})\$-
                   and the \$H^{-1}\$-norm, and we derive reliable and
                   efficient localized residual-based a posteriori error
                   estimates. Numerical experiments are presented to
                   verify the a priori convergence results.},

                   propagation problems with strong multiscale features

                   of innovative high performance numerical methods
                   suitable to the simulation of such multiscale
                   problems. Particularly, we extend the multiscale
                   hybrid-mixed (MHM) finite element method for the two-
                   and three-dimensional time-dependent Maxwell
                   equations with heterogeneous coefficients. The MHM
                   method arises from the decomposition of the exact
                   electric and magnetic fields in terms of the
                   solutions of locally independent Maxwell problems
                   tied together with a one-field formulation on top of
                   a coarse-mesh skeleton. The multiscale basis
                   functions, which are responsible for upscaling, are
                   driven by local Maxwell problems with tangential
                   component of the magnetic field prescribed on faces.
                   A high-order discontinuous Galerkin method in space
                   combined with a second-order explicit leap-frog
                   scheme in time discretizes the local problems. This
                   makes the MHM method effective and yields a staggered
                   algorithm within a ``divide-and-conquer'' framework.
                   Several two-dimensional numerical tests assess the
                   optimal convergence of the MHM method and its
                   capacity to preserve the energy principle, as well as
                   its accuracy to solve heterogeneous media problems on

                   boundary. In the model, the electric permittivity and
                   magnetic permeability are symmetric, tensor-valued,
                   piecewise smooth coefficients. In all cases, the

                   depends both on the geometry and on the coefficients.
                   It relies either on classical estimates when δ>1/2,
                   or on a new combined interpolation operator when
                   δ<1/2. The optimality of the value of δ is
                   discussed with respect to abstract shift theorems. In

                   meshes. The transmission conditions across the
                   interface are derived in a unified framework for
                   three types of interface problems. Usually, the
                   well-posedness of an H1-elliptic problem requires two
                   transmission conditions for both the solution and the
                   normal flux. The well-posedness for H(curl)- or
                   H(div)-elliptic problem requires three transmission
                   conditions. This provides the guideline for designing
                   stable high-order finite element methods on unfitted
                   meshes. Optimal error estimates are proven in energy

                   location of the interface relative to the mesh.
                   High-order numerical quadrature rules are employed to
                   compute surface integrals and volume integrals in
                   sub-domains with curved boundaries which are produced

                   First, for the Lagrange interpolation we prove
                   optimal error estimates, both in order and
                   regularity, in Lp for $p > 2$. For p = 2 it is known

                   results we obtain an optimal order error estimate for
                   functions slightly more regular than H2. These
                   results are valid both for tetrahedral and

                   is on obtaining optimal convergence rates in the
                   H(curl) norm for higher order elements. Two types of
                   estimates are presented: First, interpolation error
                   estimates for functions in anisotropic weighted
                   Sobolev spaces. Here we consider not only the
                   H(curl)-conforming N{\'e}d{\'e}lec elements, but also
                   the H(div)-conforming Raviart-Thomas elements which
                   appear naturally in the discrete version of the de
                   Rham complex. Our technique is to transport error
                   estimates from the reference element to the physical
                   element via highly anisotropic coordinate
                   transformations. Second, Galerkin error estimates for
                   the standard H(curl) approximation of time harmonic
                   Maxwell equations. Here we use the anisotropic
                   weighted Sobolev regularity of the solution on
                   domains with three-dimensional edges and corners. We
                   also prove the discrete compactness property needed
                   for the convergence of the Maxwell eigenvalue
                   problem. Our results generalize those of {$[$}40{$]$}

                   ``polynomial'' order k and three space dimensions.
                   Although the main focus of the present study is to
                   illustrate some h-convergence tests for different
                   orders k, we also hint on other interesting aspects
                   such as structured polyhedral Voronoi meshing,
                   robustness in the presence of irregular grids,
                   sensibility to the stabilization parameter and
                   convergence with respect to the order k.},
