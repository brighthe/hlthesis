    abstract = {In this paper we introduce the \$hp\$-version
discontinuous Galerkin composite finite element
method for the discretization of second-order
elliptic partial differential equations. This class
of methods allows for the approximation of problems
posed on computational domains which may contain a
huge number of local geometrical features, or
microstructures. While standard numerical methods can
be devised for such problems, the computational
effort may be extremely high, as the minimal number
of elements needed to represent the underlying domain
can be very large. In contrast, the minimal dimension
of the underlying composite finite element space is
independent of the number of geometric features. The
key idea in the construction of this latter class of
methods is that the computational domain \$\Omega\$
is no longer resolved by the mesh; instead, the
finite element basis (or shape) functions are adapted
to the geometric details present in \$\Omega\$. In
this paper, we extend these ideas to the
discontinuous Galerkin setting, based on employing
the \$hp\$-version of the finite element method.
Numerical experiments highlighting the practical
application of the proposed numerical scheme will be

    abstract = {We present, on the simplest possible case, what we
consider as the very basic features of the (brand
new) virtual element method. As the readers will
easily recognize, the virtual element method could
easily be regarded as the ultimate evolution of the
mimetic finite differences approach. However, in
their last step they became so close to the
traditional finite elements that we decided to use a
different perspective and a different name. Now the
virtual element spaces are just like the usual finite
element spaces with the addition of suitable
non-polynomial functions. This is far from being a
new idea. See for instance the very early approach of
E. Wachspress [A Rational Finite Element Basic
(Academic Press, 1975)] or the more recent overview
of T.-P. Fries and T. Belytschko [The
extended/generalized finite element method: An
overview of the method and its applications, Int. J.
Numer. Methods Engrg.84 (2010) 253--304]. The novelty
here is to take the spaces and the degrees of freedom
in such a way that the elementary stiffness matrix
can be computed without actually computing these
non-polynomial functions, but just using the degrees
of freedom. In doing that we can easily deal with
complicated element geometries and/or higher-order
continuity conditions (like C1, C2, etc.). The idea
is quite general, and could be applied to a number of
different situations and problems. Here however we
want to be as clear as possible, and to present the
simplest possible case that still gives the flavor of
the whole idea.},

It relies either on classical estimates when δ>1/2,

δ<1/2. The optimality of the value of δ is
discussed with respect to abstract shift theorems. In
some simple configurations, typically for

multiscale method (HMM) for the time-harmonic Maxwell
equations in locally periodic media. The method is
constructed by using a divergence-regularization in
one of the cell problems. This allows us to introduce
fine-scale correctors that are not subject to a
cumbersome divergence-free constraint and which can
hence easily be implemented. To analyze the method,
we first revisit classical homogenization theory for
time-harmonic Maxwell equations and derive a new
homogenization result that makes use of the
divergence-regularization in the two-scale
homogenized equation. We then show that the HMM is
equivalent to a discretization of this equation. In
particular, writing both problems in a fully coupled
two-scale formulation is the crucial starting point
for a corresponding numerical analysis of the method.
With this approach we are able to prove rigorous a
priori error estimates in the \$\mathbf{H}({curl})\$-

propagation problems with strong multiscale features
(in space and time). Our goal is to design a family
of innovative high performance numerical methods
suitable to the simulation of such multiscale
problems. Particularly, we extend the multiscale
hybrid-mixed (MHM) finite element method for the two-
and three-dimensional time-dependent Maxwell
equations with heterogeneous coefficients. The MHM
method arises from the decomposition of the exact
electric and magnetic fields in terms of the
solutions of locally independent Maxwell problems
tied together with a one-field formulation on top of
a coarse-mesh skeleton. The multiscale basis
functions, which are responsible for upscaling, are
driven by local Maxwell problems with tangential
component of the magnetic field prescribed on faces.
A high-order discontinuous Galerkin method in space
combined with a second-order explicit leap-frog
scheme in time discretizes the local problems. This
makes the MHM method effective and yields a staggered
algorithm within a ``divide-and-conquer'' framework.
Several two-dimensional numerical tests assess the
optimal convergence of the MHM method and its
capacity to preserve the energy principle, as well as
its accuracy to solve heterogeneous media problems on
coarse meshes.},

Galerkin method of minimal dimension on general

The method can be flexibly applied to rough grids
such as the highly distorted trapezoidal grid, and
both \$h\$ perturbation and \$h^2\$ perturbation of
the smooth grids. Optimal convergence rates for both
the potential and vector variables are achieved for
smooth solutions. On the other hand, the lowest order
method can be particularly useful for computing rough
solutions. We provide a priori error analysis for
problems with low regularity. Next, adaptive mesh
refinement is an attractive tool for general meshes
due to their flexibility and simplicity in handling
hanging nodes. Therefore, we derive a simple
residual-type error estimator on the \$L^2\$ error in
vector variable, and the reliability and efficiency
of the proposed error estimator are proved. Numerical
results indicate that optimal convergence can be
achieved for both the potential and vector variables,

the work to the construction of projections that best

applications, we analyze four variants of HDG methods

\$\mathfrak{B+}\$, \$\mathfrak{H+}\$), where two of
them are known (variants \$\mathfrak{H}\$,
\$\mathfrak{B+}\$) and the other two are new
(variants \$\mathfrak{H+}\$, \$\mathfrak{B}\$). Under
certain regularity assumptions, we show that all four
variants are optimally convergent and that variants
\$\mathfrak{B+}\$ and \$\mathfrak{H+}\$ achieve
superconvergence without postprocessing. For the two
known variants, we prove their optimal convergence
under weaker requirements of the meshes and the
stabilization functions thanks to the new analysis
techniques being introduced. For solution with
low-regularity, we give an analysis to these methods
and investigate the effect of different stabilization
functions on the convergence. At the end, we provide
numerical experiments to support the analysis.},

    abstract = {In this article, interface-penalty finite element
methods are proposed to solve interface problems in
H1, H(curl), H(div) spaces on unfitted tetrahedral
meshes. The transmission conditions across the
interface are derived in a unified framework for
three types of interface problems. Usually, the
well-posedness of an H1-elliptic problem requires two
transmission conditions for both the solution and the
normal flux. The well-posedness for H(curl)- or
H(div)-elliptic problem requires three transmission
conditions. This provides the guideline for designing
stable high-order finite element methods on unfitted
meshes. Optimal error estimates are proven in energy
norms for interface-penalty finite element methods
within a unified framework for H1, H(curl), and
H(div). All error estimates are independent of the
location of the interface relative to the mesh.
High-order numerical quadrature rules are employed to
compute surface integrals and volume integrals in
sub-domains with curved boundaries which are produced
by the intersection of the interface and the
tetrahedral mesh. Numerical examples show optimal
convergence of the proposed finite element methods
for piecewise smooth solutions.},

solution admits a decomposition into a regular part v

abstract = {In this paper, a novel higher stabilization-free virtual element method is proposed for compressible hyper-elastic materials in 2D. Different from the most traditional virtual element formulation, the method does not need any stabilization. The main idea is to modify the virtual element space to allow the computation of a higher-order polynomial L2 projection of the gradient. Based on that the stiffness matrix can be obtained directly which greatly simplifies the analysis process, especially for nonlinear problems. Hyper-elastic materials are considered and some benchmark nonlinear problems are solved to verify the capability and accuracy of the stabilization-free virtual element method.}
